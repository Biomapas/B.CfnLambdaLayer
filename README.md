# B.CfnLambdaLayer

Easy lambda dependency management is here!<br> This is an AWS CDK resource that acts as a
`LayerVersion` resource but with more convenient approach to specify and bundle dependencies.

### Description

AWS CDK already makes it incredibly simple to package code for lambda functions and 
layers by exposing `Code` resource and methods like `Code.from_asset()`. However, it is very
difficult to add additional dependencies to your layer code e.g. `jose`, `requests`, newer `boto3` library, etc.
This custom layer resource makes packaging code with dependencies extremely simple like 2 + 2! You 
simply specify a dictionary of dependencies to include and this resource will do the rest.
<br><br>
You should note that this resource uses `docker` to bundle code and dependencies.

This project assumes you know what Lambda functions are and how code is being shared between them
(Lambda layers). 

- Excellent knowledge in IaaC (Infrastructure as a Code) principles.
- Excellent knowledge in Lambda functions and Lambda layers.  
- Good experience in AWS CDK and AWS CloudFormation.
- Good Python skills and basis of OOP.

### Install

Before installing this library, ensure you have these tools setup:

- Python / Pip
- AWS CDK
- Docker

To install this project from source run:

```
pip install .
```


Or you can install it from a PyPi repository:

```
pip install b-cfn-lambda-layer
```


### Usage & Examples

The most convenient feature of this resource is easy dependency management. When creating a new layer
you simply supply a dictionary of dependencies, and they will be installed and packaged to you layer
at a deployment level:

```python
from b_cfn_lambda_layer.package_version import PackageVersion

dependencies = {
    'python-jose': PackageVersion.from_string_version('3.3.0'),
    'boto3': PackageVersion.from_string_version('1.16.35'),
    'botocore': PackageVersion.from_string_version('1.19.35')
}
```

This is a full example where we create a lambda layer and use it in lambda function.

```python
from aws_cdk.aws_lambda import Function, Code, Runtime
from aws_cdk.core import Stack

from b_cfn_lambda_layer.lambda_layer import LambdaLayer
from b_cfn_lambda_layer.package_version import PackageVersion

# Create layer with custom dependencies.
layer = LambdaLayer(
    scope=Stack(...),
    name='TestLayer',
    # You can conveniently specify path to source code to include.
    source_path='/path/to/your/layer/source/code',
    code_runtimes=[Runtime.PYTHON_3_6, Runtime.PYTHON_3_7, Runtime.PYTHON_3_8],
    # You can conveniently specify dependencies to include.
    dependencies={
        'python-jose': PackageVersion.from_string_version('3.3.0'),
        'boto3': PackageVersion.from_string_version('1.16.35'),
        'botocore': PackageVersion.from_string_version('1.19.35')
    }
)

# Create a function with a layer.
Function(
    scope=Stack(...),
    id='MyFunction',
    code=Code.from_asset('/path/to/lambda/function/code'),
    handler='index.handler',
    runtime=Runtime.PYTHON_3_6,
    # Specify layers.
    layers=[layer]
)
```

### Testing
